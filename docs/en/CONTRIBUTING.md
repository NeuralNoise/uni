# CONTRIBUTING

Contributions are always welcome.
Keep the code more simple as you can.

Before you writing anything, feature or bug fix:

- Check if there is already an issue related to it (opened or closed) and if someone is already working on that;
    - If there is not, open an issue and notify everybody that you're going to work on that;
    - If there is, create a comment to notify everybody that you're going to work on that.
- Make sure that what you need is not done yet.

So, let's go:

- Fork it!
- Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
- Test your changes using the **recompile tool**. Very simple to use that. Just go on terminal to src/tools/ and execute the recompiler (eg. ./recompile). Your changes will be available to use and test locally using uni command.
- Commit your changes: git commit -m 'Add some feature'
- Push to the branch: git push origin my-new-feature
- Send your pull request.

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch.
